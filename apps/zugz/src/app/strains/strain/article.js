            The Hillbilly Pumpkin strain is a genetic offshoot of the original
            Hillbilly strain of

              <em>Psilocybe cubensis</em>

            . It’s not famed for its potency — producing less than 0.60% total
            tryptamines — but it’s a fantastic microdose shroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            This strain is renowned for its utterly bizarre fruits. The
            mushrooms are large and round — often resembling small pumpkins. The
            white stems are usually thicker than the caps, which are light brown
            caps and have distinct wavy edges.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re looking for a super-potent strain, Hillbilly Pumpkin isn’t
            the choice for you. However, if you’re dabbling with the idea of
            microdosing or wish to grow something unlike any other cube on the
            market, it’s the perfect choice.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The Hillbilly strain has been around since the late 1990s. A
            frequent Mycotopia user that goes by the online handle “Hillbilly”
            is responsible for collecting and taming the strain in Arkansas in
            the Southern United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original Hillbilly strain occasionally throws out a fatass
            mushroom in a flush. It’s believed that a cultivator by the name
            “Mycology Mage” isolated spores from a large pumpkin-shaped fatass
            phenotype and created the strain from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re not entirely sure of this origin story, and the spores
            available for the strain seem somewhat inconsistent. Some
            cultivators report fatass shrooms as round as a bowling ball,
            weighing in at 200 grams fresh. Others report a single flush of
            small “pumpkin-like shrooms” before the colony reverts to
            normal-looking Hillbilly shrooms.&nbsp;

            The Hillbilly Pumpkin strain isn’t famed for its potency. We’ve
            ranked this strain as “Weak” — producing less than 0.60% total
            tryptamines. However, that’s not to say it’s useless. The Hillbilly
            Pumpkin strain is ideal for people that want to microdose — its
            mother strain (Hillbilly) even won a spot as the “Microdose
            Champion” in the Spring 2022{" "}

          <p>
            The Hillbilly Pumpkin strain’s large mushroom size and weak potency
            make it easy to divide into accurate microdoses. Even half a gram of
            dried Hillbilly pumpkin could be considered a microdose. It’s far
            easier to split shrooms into half-gram doses than 0.05-gram doses,
            as is sometimes needed with more potent mushrooms.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            These shrooms deserve a lot more recognition than they get, and
            hopefully, they’ll grow in popularity as amateur cultivators begin
            to explore their potential as “microdose shrooms.”

            has been around since the late 1990s. It was created by a mycologist
            that goes by the name “Hillbilly” — hence the naming of the strain.
            It was originally collected from somewhere in Arkansas in the

            the Spring 2022 Oakland Hyphae Psilocybin Cup as a “Microdose
            Champion.” The sample produced a mere 0.24% psilocybin level, 0.11

            strain is a rare variant of the original that produces short
            mushrooms with flat doughnut-like caps. Not much is known about the
            history of the strain, but a few Shroomery users have got their
            hands on spore samples.

            The fruits produced are similar to the Hillbilly Pumpkin strain,
            except they’re smaller, have flatter caps, and thinner stems. The
            potency of the Hillbilly Pancake strain is likely comparable to the
            original Hillbilly strain — producing less than 0.60% total

              <strong>How to Grow Hillbilly Pumpkin Mushrooms</strong>
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Hillbilly Pumpkin strain is a prolific fruiter and capable of
            producing massive yields over several flushes. The mushrooms can
            grow to monstrous sizes, too — with some cultivators reporting
            single samples weighing over 200 grams (fresh).&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s an easily-grown strain thanks to its contamination resistance,
            aggressive mycelium, and ability to grow in an unoptimized
            environment. It’s an excellent choice for beginners who want to
            start with something more interesting than the typical Golden
            Teacher strain.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            However, spore samples only come in swab format, which makes it
            trickier for those new to growing. When using swabs, there’s a risk
            of contamination when inoculating the substrate. Therefore, the
            spores must first be{" "}
            <a href="https://tripsitter.com/magic-mushrooms/cultivation/agar-tek/?amp=1">
              isolated on agar
            </a>{" "}
            to remove any potential contaminants and extract the strongest
            Hillbilly Pumpkin mycelium. This extra step is relatively simple,
            but it can be confusing for newbies to mushroom cultivation.

            The easiest way to cultivate shrooms is using a cultivation method
            known as PF Tek. It’s easy to grow <em>Psilocybe cubensis </em>using
            this technique when you can access sterile spore-filled
            syringes.&nbsp;

            is a classic Thai strain originally discovered by the legendary
            shroom hunter “John Allen” during his travels through Southeast Asia
            in the 1990s. The first sample was collected from the island of Koh
            Samui — hence the name of the strain. This strain is famed for
            producing dense flushes of “fatass” mushrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considered “average potency,” Koh Samui mushrooms appear to sit
            consistently in the range of 0.69% and 0.86% total tryptamines. Like
            many Southeast Asian strains, this strain is incredibly resistant to

            It’s not all about mind-blowing psychedelic trips. Although
            super-potent <em>Psilocybe cubensis </em>strains often take the
            podium, weaker ones can be good for microdosing because they’re
            easier to divide into sub-perceptual doses.&nbsp;

          <p>
            The Hillbilly Pumpkin and original Hillbilly strains are great for
            microdosing, with the latter winning a place in the Spring 2022
            Hyphae Psilocybin Cup “Microdose Champion” category.&nbsp;

          <p>
            The most potent strain of <em>P. cubensis </em>is Penis Envy. This
            strain is responsible for over a dozen super-potent strains. We

            There’s also a range of other tryptamines present in psilocybin
            mushrooms that may also be responsible for some of the psychoactive
            effects associated with magic mushroom consumption. However, further
            study into these compounds is needed before they’re categorized as
