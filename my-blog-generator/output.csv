An invasive species is an organism not native to a particular area and can cause damage to the local environment.</p>\n    <h2>Food for Nature</h2>\n    <p>As with anything in nature, weed is part of the food web. Many critters will flock to wild cannabis plants to devour them. The leaves, seeds, and roots of the plant are all highly nutritious and loved by herbivores around the world.</p>\n    <img decoding=\""async\"" width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\"" srcset=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-1024x683.png 1024w, https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-300x200.png 300w, https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-768x512.png 768w, https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-850x567.png 850w, https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant-155x103.png 155w, https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/deer-eating-weed-plant.png 1500w\"" sizes=\""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"" />\n    <h2>What's the Difference Between Wild Weed & Cultivated Weed?</h2>\n    <p>Most of the weed we use comes from unfertilized female plants. Growers discard the male plants as soon as possible, as they don't produce flowers, and fertilized females make fewer cannabinoids. Wild weed is not subject to those controls — males and females grow freely, and humans do not curate fertilization.</p>\n    <h2>What's the Difference Between Wild Weed & Ditch Weed?</h2>\n    <p>You might have heard people referring to wild strains of weed as 'ditch weed' and assumed it's a synonym for all kinds of wild marijuana.

"Need to Detox from Weed? Here Are 4 Methods to Try - Tripsitter","https://tripsitter.com/cannabis/detox/","{   ""title"": ""Need to Detox from Weed? Here Are 4 Methods to Try"",   ""content"": ""<div>\n<h1>Need to Detox from Weed? Here Are 4 Methods to Try</h1>\n<img width=\""850\"" height=\""567\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Detox-from-Weed-Quickly-COver-850x567.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n<h2>By Phil Dubley</h2>\n<h2>Last Updated: February 02, 2024</h2>\n\n<h2>Contents</h2>\n<h3>Weed Detox: Fundamentals</h3>\n<p>THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) — the active ingredient in marijuana — can saturate fat cells throughout the body, making detoxing quite a bit more challenging than other substances. Don’t fret; there are ways to clear THC from the system more quickly, but it takes some discipline. Here’s how it’s done.</p>\n\n<h4>1. Abstain from THC</h4>\n<p>The most straightforward way to detox from weed is to refrain from using THC products. If you’re applying for jobs, take time off from weed right away to give your body more time to flush it all out of the system. It will be easier to pass a drug test if you anticipate it.</p>\n\n<img width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/Abstain-From-Weed-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n\n<h4>2. Increase Liver Detoxification With Supplements</h4>\n<p>The liver processes THC into 11-OH-THC. This metabolite is the compound most urine drug tests look for. By increasing the liver’s ability to convert THC to 11-OH-THC, you can eliminate it from the body more quickly. Many products are designed to help with this — usually in the form of detox drinks, powders, or capsules.</p>\n\n<img width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/Milk-Thistle-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n\n<h4>3. Increase Urination</h4>\n<p>Drinking water frequently while detoxing is important for eliminating THC from the body. Water helps flush the 11-OH-THC from the bloodstream. Diuretics are also helpful. These are substances that increase the frequency of urination, combined with plenty of water, are the best way to clear THC metabolites from the body more quickly.</p>\n\n<img width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/Increase-Urination-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n\n<h4>4. Promote Fat Burning</h4>\n<p>THC is fat-soluble, which means it will accumulate in stored fat cells. This stored THC can slowly infuse back into the bloodstream and show up on a drug test. An important step during the detox process is to try and flush this stored THC from the fat cells through increased exercise and calorie reduction.</p>\n\n<img width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/Fat-Burning-Exercise-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n\n<h3>How Long Does Weed Stay In Your System?</h3>\n<p>The amount of time weed stays in the system largely depends on how often you smoke. Other factors that influence THC detox include genetics, size and weight, age, and illness.</p>\n\n<h3>Cannabis Withdrawal Symptoms</h3>\n<p>The most common symptoms associated with marijuana withdrawal include irritability, anxiety, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, restlessness, and more. While these can be challenging, they are not considered severe and should improve after a week.</p>\n\n<h3>FAQs: Weed Detox</h3>\n<img width=\""1024\"" height=\""683\"" src=\""https://tripsitter.com/wp-content/uploads/Weed-Question-Mark-1024x683.png\"" alt=\""\""/>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you speed up weed detox?</li>\n<li>What happens if you get caught cheating on a drug test?</li>\n<li>Are detox teas effective?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>References are provided for further reading on THC detox and marijuana withdrawal symptoms.</p>\n\n</div>"" }"

Is sativa or indica better for hunger?</p><img src='image_url' alt='weed munchies' height='683' width='1024'/><h2>Why Does Food Taste Better When You’re High?</h2><p>This is another well-known effect of the munchies — not only do you feel hungrier and crave specific types of food, but they also taste better.</p><p>The answer is, again, cannabinoids. When THC interacts with your brain to increase your appetite, it also affects brain receptors associated with taste. This makes the brain’s response to sweet food stronger while also making you crave fatty foods.</p><img src='image_url' alt='weed munchies 2' height='683' width='1024'/><h2>How Long Do the Munchies Last?</h2><p>Every person reacts differently to weed, so the answer varies depending on individual reactions and how much marijuana is consumed.</p><p>If you smoke weed, the effects take up to 10 minutes to manifest and last for 2 to 3 hours. But if you eat or drink cannabis, the effects won’t manifest until 2 hours later, with the effects lasting between 6 and 8 hours (if not more).</p><h2>Managing the Munchies</h2><p>The best way to reduce or avoid the munchies when smoking weed or eating edibles is to consume low-THC products.</p><p>As THC is the primary (but not only) cannabinoid responsible for increasing appetite, taking smaller doses can lessen or completely negate the munchies. Products labeled as “THC microdoses” are the least likely to give you the munchies.</p><h2>Does Weed Cause Weight Gain?</h2><p>The answer to this question is complicated, and there is conflicting evidence, but so far, most studies show that there is no link between cannabis use and BMI.</p><img src='image_url' alt='weed and weight gain' height='683' width='1024'/><h2>Can You Block Your Cannabinoid Receptors?</h2><p>We know that cannabinoid receptors (specifically CB1) increase appetite when activated by THC, so it makes sense that blocking them would decrease it.</p><h3>FAQs: The Weed Munchies</h3><p>Here are the answers to some questions you might be asking.</p><p>1.
